I am a Staff Computer Vision and Robotics Engineer at [Deltia GmbH](https://www.deltia.ai/), a Berlin-based startup founded within the [Merantix Group](https://www.merantix.com/) ecosystem.

My research and engineering focus on building Vision-Language Models for manufacturing, enabling our clients to gain insights through temporal action segmentation and leveraging these models in robotic learning to automate manual assembly tasks.

I obtained my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Prof. Stefan Roth, Ph.D.](https://www.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/visual_inference/people_vi/stefan_roth.en.jsp) in the Visual Inference Group at Technische Universität Darmstadt. During my Ph.D., I was employed by Volkswagen Group Research and Cariad SE, where I was a major contributor to the VW Group's decision-making and planning system for fully automated driving, working alongside Simon Großjohann and Silviu Homoceanu. My research focused on unifying prediction and planning in a hybrid approach to implement humanlike, assertive, and safe driving in interactive environments.

I am passionate about designing and engineering AI systems that work under real-world conditions.
